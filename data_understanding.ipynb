Hosts should note in the description if they'll be on the property or not (ex: \"Host occupies first floor of the home\"), and provide further details on the listing.\n",

You might need to walk through indoor spaces that another host or guest may occupy to get to your room.\n",

When you book a shared room, you'll be sleeping in a space that is shared with others and share the entire space with other people. Shared rooms are popular among flexible travelers looking for new friends and budget-friendly stays."
